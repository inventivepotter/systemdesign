# Smart Music
Come up with the LL Design for "Smart Music" App, which allows the user to:
1. Create a playlist (album)
2. Play the playlist (album)

Playlist can have a song or it can have an album (another playlist). Again, an album can have a sub-album (another playlist). 

For example, "My Long Drive" playlist would may something like below:
1. Bollywood Mix (album)
    1. Song 1
    2. Song 2
2. Club Mix (album)
    1. Paradise (Song 3)
    2. Song 4
    3. country-club mix (album)
3. Random song (Song)

As a part of this discussion assignment:

1. You are required to submit a UML Class Diagram of your design.

2. Support your design with proper explanation of the responsibilities of each class/interface.

3. Talk about the trade-offs, if there are any conscious Design Decisions that you are taking.
