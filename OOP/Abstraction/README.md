# Abstraction
Hiding the internal implementation & data while revealing method signiture or defining a contract at design level is called as Abstraction.

`interface` is the best examples of achieving abstraction. `abstract classes` also useful to achieve abstraction where available.

In the example abstraction.go, a method "Area" defined in interface level but the implementation details were not revealed in the interface it self.
